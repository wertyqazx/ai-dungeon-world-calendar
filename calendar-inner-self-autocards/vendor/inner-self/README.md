# Inner Self 🎭
### *Giving characters minds of their own~*
Made by LewdLeah ❤️

---

## Overview

Inner Self is an AI Dungeon mod that grants memory, goals, secrets, planning, and self-reflection capabilities to the characters living in your story. Simulated agents build and maintain their own minds to learn from experiences, form opinions, and adapt their behavior over time. Inner Self provides the AI with the tools it needs to truly embody characters, allowing them to feel more alive and nuanced over long adventures.

In some ways this is the spiritual successor to [Auto-Cards](https://github.com/LewdLeah/Auto-Cards), which is already included with Inner Self and can be enabled at any time.

## Gameplay Tips

- Read the in-game config card to learn how to easily add NPCs
- Set response length to 200 tokens if you notice short or empty outputs
- Enable scripts if you don't see a config card (homepage > settings > gameplay)
- Protect your mental health: Inner Self is intended to be a narrative experience only
- Plot components matter because the AI sees them when writing thoughts
- Different story models also tend to manage brains differently
- But avoid Atlas and Raven models for this one 😅

## For Creators

### Creator Control Panel
At the very top of the Inner Self `Library` script tab, you'll find optional settings with simple explanations. Modify these before publishing to customize your scenario's default experience.

### Preparing Scenario NPCs
To work on its own, provide Inner Self with the names of your scenario's most important NPCs. Inner Self will create a new brain card for each NPC you prepare, after their name appears in the story. (Kinda like story card triggers, if that makes sense!) Brains are created on-demand to avoid overwhelming players.

Creators provide Inner Self with scenario NPC names in one of two ways:

<details>
<summary><b>regular method (click to expand)</b></summary>

In the creator control panel near the top of your `Library` script tab:
```javascript
// List the first name of every scenario NPC whose brain should be simulated by Inner Self:
IMPORTANT_SCENARIO_CHARACTERS: ""
// (write a comma separated list of names inside the "" like so: "Leah, Lily, Lydia")
```
Simply list your NPC names inside the quotations. Then click the yellow `SAVE` button!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>alternative method for mobile creators (click to expand)</b></summary>
  
Prefix regular AID story card titles with the `@` symbol so Inner Self knows which characters should think:
- Example card name: `@Leah`
- Remember to use simple first names here!
- This method is easier on mobile

</details>

### Custom NPC Brains
Inner Self uses the full context of your scenario to form minds that follow your creative vision. No extra effort required.

But if you want more advanced control:

<details>
<summary><b>initial thoughts (click to expand)</b></summary>
  
1. Transfer any NPC brain card from adventure to scenario
2. Leave the card entry completely empty
3. Replace the notes section with any valid string-valued JSON
4. Feel free to use an AI assistant to transform your concept into valid JSON by filling out the prompt below:
````markdown
# You are a JSON generator:
- Always reply with valid JSON only, no extra text
- Base your output on the instructions provided
- Do not include comments or explanations

## Overarching setting:
```
[Describe the setting of your scenario here!]
```

## Fictional character concept:
```
[Describe your character concept here!]
```

## Task instructions:
Your task is to transform the character concept into a JSON object
- The object should resemble a flat collection of key-value pairs
- All values are strings written from the character's inner 1st person PoV
- Values should be short single-sentence thoughts that capture core aspects
- Keys use distinct and descriptive lower snake_case syntax
- The object represents the character's identity of self
- Be creative when roleplaying as the character
- Respect the overarching setting
````

## Changelog

<details>
<summary><b>(click to expand)</b></summary>

### 1.0.2
- Added config "Brain card notes store brains as JSON"
- When disabled, brain card notes use a simpler colon + newline delimited format instead of JSON
- Makes it much easier to manually edit NPC thoughts without accidentally breaking syntax
- Backward and forward compatible; both formats are safe during parsing
- Pull request by [dirtymined13](https://github.com/dirtymined13)

### 1.0.1
- Added config "Half thought chance for Do/Say/Story"
- Lets players decide if the thought formation chance should be reduced by half during Do/Say/Story turns
- This reduction was previously mandatory in v1.0.0, to help enforce player agency when using free models
- Pull request by [-Vinny-](https://play.aidungeon.com/profile/-Vinny-)

### 1.0.0
- Inner Self released!
